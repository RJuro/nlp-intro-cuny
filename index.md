{% include figure.html img="uidaho-workshop.jpg" alt="intro image here" caption="NLP Workshop 1956" width="75%" %}

## Content

In this 2-part PDW we are going to learn about different language processing techniques that may be useful for your research. The workshops will be very practical and using Python as a platform for working with text data.

* The first part will provide an overall picture of NLP techniques and what they can be used for. We are also going to work with text data.

* Part two will go deeper and introduce supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches in combination with text data. You will learn how to make predictions from text data e.g. calculate sentiment scores from reviews or assign job descriptions to a certain category. We will also have a look at topic modelling - a unsupervised technique to explore collections of texts.
